Description: Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for clustering - implements methods in accompanying publication "clusterBMA: Bayesian Model Averaging for Clustering" (CITATION)
    The main function, clusterBMA::clusterBMA() takes as an input argument a list of cluster allocation probability matrices. Each item in the list needs to be a NxK matrix A_m for each input algorithm. For 'soft' clustering algorithms like ClusterR::GMM(), this is an available output. For 'hard' clustering algorithms like k-means, a helper function clusterBMA::hard_to_prob_fn() can be used to convert a vector of cluster allocation labels to a NxK matrix of cluster allocation probabilities. The number of clusters K can vary between input models.
